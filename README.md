MapReduceSimulator
==================

Simulate the algorithms by doing some local map reduce tasks using python

data/MapReduce.py -- the function doing the mapreduce. All other scripts calls this method to do map and reduce.

data/inverted_index.py -- Create an Inverted index. Given a set of documents, an inverted index is a dictionary where each word is associated with a list of the document identifiers in which that word appears.

data/join.py -- Implement a relational join as a MapReduce query

data/friend_count.py -- a MapReduce algorithm to count the number of friends for each person.

data/asymmetric_friendships.py -- Generate a list of all non-symmetric friend relationships.

data/unique_trims.py -- a MapReduce query to remove the last 10 characters from each string of nucleotides, then remove any duplicates generated.

data/multiply.py -- a MapReduce algorithm to compute the matrix multiplication A x B
